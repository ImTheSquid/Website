[Purdue Hackers](https://purduehackers.com) is a student organization
        focused on helping people create interesting technical projects in a fun
        environment.
- I run the Engineering Division, having weekly meetings to discuss
progress with other Engineering organizers to keep them on track and
budget.
- I was also the Interim President, running all club functions including a callout with 200+ attendees while leadership reshuffled.
- From mid 2023 to late 2024 I worked on a large-scale project called [The Sign](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/sign), a meter-tall representation of a Conway glider, the Purdue Hackers
logo. It was accepted to Hackaday and received over a thousand hits.
