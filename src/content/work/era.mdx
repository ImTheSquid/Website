[Era Computer](https://era.computer) is a startup focused on making AI accessible to makers in both the hardware and software realms without needing extensive experience in preexisting flows and architectures.

I am currently working on [Beacons](https://github.com/ImTheSquid/beacons), a hardware/software project to get people involved at events. The current goal is to put it into use at Hack Night, a weekly hacker festival run by [Purdue Hackers](https://purduehackers.com), to get new members involved and foster collaboration amongst existing projects.
