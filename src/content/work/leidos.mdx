The [Leidos Innovation Center](https://careers.leidos.com/pages/leidosinnovationscenter) is Leidos's research and development division.
- I created and refined GPU-based signal processing algorithms in CUDA, Rust, and Python for real-time applications.
- I also created a real-time machine learning model to lock onto radar targets hidden in interference patterns using time-aware strategies and PyTorch.
