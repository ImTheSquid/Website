      I work to create concise, creative solutions to the problems the world
      faces and have fun while doing so. I&apos;m a junior studying computer
      science, artificial intelligence, and mathematics at Purdue (and
      University College Dublin!). I have over a decade of experience in all
      programming disciplines and I like to bike, read, explore, and ski.
