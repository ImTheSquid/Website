      Hi, I&apos;m Jack! I work to create concise, creative solutions to the
      problems the world faces and have fun while doing so. I&apos;m a junior
      studying computer science, artificial intelligence, and mathematics at
      Purdue (and UCD!). I have over a decade of experience in all programming
      disciplines, but I also like to explore, bike, read, and ski.
