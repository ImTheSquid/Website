    <p class="md:text-lg font-serif">
      I work to create concise, creative solutions to the problems the world
      faces and have fun while doing so. I graduated from Purdue with degrees in
      computer science, artificial intelligence, and mathematics in Fall 2025,
      and I&apos;m currently working at Era Labs as a fellow. My interests lie
      in deep reinforcement learning, where I hope to discover new and
      innovative ways to make models learn complex policies with applications in
      problem analysis, critical thinking, robotics, vision, and low-data
      learning. I have over a decade of experience in all programming
      disciplines and you'll find me reading, writing, taking apart whatever
      electronics I can get my hands on, designing software and hardware, and
      exploring the world.
